* [State Data](#toc_0)

_______________________

State Data
----------

The state data is a simple key-value store that is unique to your merchant account. You can set a piece
of data using `general.setState` and later retrieve it using `general.getState`. The data is stored and
returned as a string but you could serialize your data using any serialization method you like.

<p class="text-warning">
This feature is intended to be used sparingly, such as to store a timestamp of the last time a synchronization
occurred. It is **not** intended to be used to store state information for every order.
</p>
